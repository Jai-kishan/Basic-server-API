also you need to install virtualenv 

virtualenv is a virtual Python environment builder. It helps a user to create multiple Python environments side-by-side. Thereby, it can avoid compatibility issues between the different versions of the libraries.

pip install virtualenv 


Sudo apt-get install virtualenv


mkdir newproj
cd newproj
virtualenv venv

venv/bin/activate   or  
. venv/bin/activate


pip install Flask
